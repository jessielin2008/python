## Introduction

This is my certification project for the SE DP+ML specialization group training. 

The data used in this project is from Kaggle. Quoting from kaggle, â€œThe datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have **492 frauds out of 284,807** transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

The whole project consists of three parts:
* Part 1: Data Transformation             `cpart1.py` 
* Part 2: Data Analysis and Visualization `cpart2.py`
* Part 3: Machine Learning                `cpart3.py`
